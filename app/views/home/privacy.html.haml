In certain situations, these businesses sell items or provide promotions to you through Qwiqq's Service.

    %b Business Transfers: 
    In the event that Qwiqq enters into any change of control, asset sale, or similar transaction, all data and rights related to the Service, or in the unlikely event that Qwiqq goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, your information, including Personal Information, would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.  %p 
    %b Protection of Qwiqq and Others: 
    We may view or access your Personal Information for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of our [Link: Terms of Use]. We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; to exercise our legal rights; defend against legal claims; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Qwiqq, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
    
  %h1 Cookies and Tracking  %p Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Qwiqq cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your email address is.  %p Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  %p Qwiqq uses Google Analytics to better understand who is using the Service, and how people are using it. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, and time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to improve the Service and make it appealing to as many users as possible. Google has developed a #{link_to("browser plugin", "http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en")} to allow you to opt-out of Google Analytics' tracking software.

However, Qwiqq cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.  %p The Service may contain links to other sites.
